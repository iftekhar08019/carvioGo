# Deployment Guide - API Configuration Fix

## 🚨 Issue
Your website is deployed on Firebase but the API calls are not working because they're configured for localhost/development environment.

## 🔧 Solution

### Step 1: Set Environment Variable in Firebase

You need to set the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable in your Firebase project:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**:
   - Visit [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Select your project (carviogo)

2. **Set Environment Variable**:
   - Go to Project Settings (gear icon)
   - Scroll down to "Environment Configuration"
   - Add a new environment variable:
     - **Key**: `VITE_API_URL`
     - **Value**: `https://carvio-go-server.vercel.app`

### Step 2: Alternative - Create .env File

If you prefer to use a local environment file:

1. **Create `.env` file** in your project root:
   ```bash
   echo "VITE_API_URL=https://carvio-go-server.vercel.app" > .env
   ```

2. **Rebuild and deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

The API configuration is now set up to:
- ✅ Use relative URLs in development (proxied by Vite)
- ✅ Use full URLs in production (using environment variable)
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully
- ✅ Work with both development and production environments

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

1. **Created API Configuration** (`src/config/api.js`):
   - Handles both development and production environments
   - Uses environment variables for API URL
   - Provides consistent error handling

2. **Updated All API Calls**:
   - ✅ Login page
   - ✅ Registration page
   - ✅ AddCar page
   - ✅ MyCars page
   - ✅ AvailableCars page
   - ✅ CarDetails page
   - ✅ BookingPage
   - ✅ RecentList component

3. **Environment Detection**:
   - Development: Uses relative URLs (`/api/...`)
   - Production: Uses full URLs (`https://carvio-go-server.vercel.app/...`)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Set the environment variable** in Firebase Console
2. **Redeploy** your application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy
   ```

3. **Test** the deployed application to ensure API calls work

## 🔍 Debugging

If you still have issues:

1. **Check Browser Console** for errors
2. **Verify Environment Variable** is set correctly
3. **Ensure API Server** is running and accessible
4. **Check CORS** settings on your API server

## 📝 Notes

- The API configuration automatically detects the environment
- All API calls now use the centralized `apiRequest` function
- Error handling is improved with better logging
- The solution works for both development and production

## 🆕 Google Sign-In Issue Resolution

### Issue
Google sign-in was showing "Google login failed" error even though the user was successfully authenticated.

### Cause
The Google sign-in was working correctly (Firebase authentication succeeded), but the backend API call was failing. This caused the error message to appear even though the user was actually logged in.

### Solution
Updated the Google sign-in implementation to:
- ✅ Handle backend API failures gracefully
- ✅ Continue with login even if backend call fails
- ✅ Show success message when Firebase authentication succeeds
- ✅ Log warnings instead of errors for backend failures

### Implementation
The Google sign-in now:
1. Attempts Firebase authentication
2. If successful, tries to send JWT token to backend
3. If backend call fails, continues with login (shows warning in console)
4. Shows success message to user
5. Only shows error if Firebase authentication itself fails

This ensures a smooth user experience even when the backend API is not available or has issues.
